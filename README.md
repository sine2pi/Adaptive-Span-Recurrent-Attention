This combination should offer both efficiency for long sequences and flexibility in the attention span, making it suitable for a variety of tasks but 
ideal for tasks where the context length varies significantly, and you need to process very long sequences.

Key Points:
Chunked Processing: It processes sequences in chunks, allowing the model to handle very long sequences efficiently.

Adaptive Span: Dynamically adjusts the span of attention within each chunk, providing flexibility in how much context the model can attend to.
